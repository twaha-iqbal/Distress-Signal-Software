Crime Zone Mapping (Prototype)

This Java Swing based prototype demonstrates an idea how our Distress Signal Software plans to work with Google Maps API to visually map crime alert zones

Objectives:

i) View real time mapped zones categorized by danger levels (red,yellow,green,etc.)

ii) Identify risk zones to alert the user.

Presently, we're not able to fully integrate this feature due to time and resource limits. However, with the right tools and support, this can be made ready for application.
